# Marketplace

***

If you like commands, the Marketplace is the place to be! In here, you can look at every single command that has ever been created!

# Adding Scripts to Servers

***

If you like a command but donâ€™t have it in your server, you can simply click the blue + icon to add it to your server! (Provided you have the correct server selected next to your name!)

# Publishing Scripts

***
If you have created a script, you can then enable it to appear on the marketplace by clicking the slider in the Your Scripts section!

# Liking Scripts

***

If you really like a command, you can click the little heart icon to give it a like! Show the creator how much you like their command!


Finally, if you want to view the original code created for a script, click the little </> icon underneath the heart icon.
