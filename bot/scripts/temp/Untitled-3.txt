Cards without the term "Charged" in their descriptions should have "Charged Power Radius" and "Charged Power Regen" removed.
*FIX > if ChargedPowerRadius AND ChargedPowerRegen are both 0, remove both from description

Most cards that have actually have a "Charged Power Radius" have it scaling in Range (Couldn't we just remove it then?)
*FIX > ye read on and youll see

Spells have AoE attacks lel (they shouldn't)
*FIX > cards with Type == Spell no longer have stats under the AOE heading

Hercules Clyde's Duration should be changed to infinite
*FIX > added exception for non number durations, tried to round a string to 2dp before, that didnt work out well

All Ike's ranges are set at 1, treat this as self. Or change it to say self castss
*FIX > set ChargedPowerRadius in all of ikes cards to 'Self', a charged power radius of self != 1
*FOUND BUG & FIXED > the 'Power' field was actually 'ChargedPowerRadius', removed the latter and prefixed the former with 'Power'

Totem cards (Energy Staff and Chicken Coop) should be as basic as possible. The can't move so you could take out "Max Speed", "Time To Reach Max Speed" and "Agro Range Multiplier", and their ability just summons stuff.
*FIX > removed 'Max Speed', 'Time To Reach Max Speed', and 'Agro Range Multiplier' from all totem cards

Characters with deathwishes (excluding Officer Barbrady) don't need range in their power description
 - Butters' is closest ally
 - Kenny's is enemy that killed him
*FIX > removed 'range' as it was the same as 'charged power radius', should not show up in those cards as == 0
*ISSUE > barbrady doesnt have a range param

We should have info on Enforcer Jimmy's ability (I checked and we do, but we don't have a field for power range because I don't know, but his base range is 2.0)
*FIX > changed enforcer jimmys 'ChargedPowerRadius' to 2.0, i know its not *technically* a power radius but it works ok

Hookhand Clyde, Outlaw Tweek, and Incan Craig's Hero Damage doesn't scale
*FIX > removed scaling fields in those 3 cards as that can be calculated using base stats, power hero damage now scaling properly

Le Bard Jimmy's Ability is global
*ISSUE > if you mean the 'power range', same issue as barbrady

All Stan abilities are global
*ISSUE > set incorrectly in the json (charged power radius set to 1.0)

All Kyle Abilites are global
 - Bounty Hunter Kyle's is infinite duration
 - The Master Ninjew's is infinite duration
*ISSUE > the suration IS set to 'Infinite' already, the range is not set correctly in the json

Marcus' description doesn't scale (I check the json and it was a description issue, change "{PowerHeroDamage}" to {PowerDamage}"
*FIX > changed 'PowerHeroDamage' in desc to 'HeroDamage'

Mecha Timmy's power range has a base of 7.0, I don't know why but it is wrong in the info RL sent us
*FIX > changed 'ChargedPowerRadius' from 1.0 -> 7.0 

Medusa Bebe shouldn't have an ability range
*ISSUE > again set incorrectly in the json

Hankey's ability should be listed as global
*ISSUE > ill take a guess and assume its set incorrectly in the json

Robin Tweek's ability should be listed as global
*ISSUE > look above

Shieldmaiden Wendy's description bug
*FIX > rounded that value, also *should* fix any present and future bugs with non rounded descriptions
*NOTE > pls be more specific, this description just tells me that theres *some* issue with the card

(Did some json scanning during the bot being down, notice snake is missing the following fields in his info:
    "PowerDuration": null,
    "PowerHeal": null,
    "PowerHeroHeal": null,
    "PowerMaxHPGain": null,
    "PowerMaxHPLoss": null,
    "PowerSummonLevel": null,
    "PowerDamage": null,
    "PowerHeroDamage": null,
    "PowerPoisonAmount": null,
    "PowerHeroPoison": null,
    "PowerAttackBoost": null,
    "PowerAttackDecrease": null,
)
*FIX > added
*NOTE > non code related fixes will we rejected in the future

Warboy Tweek's ability description doesn't scale from base properly, and the duration in the embed only shows base.
*FIX > was using the bases stats instead of the level adjusted ones

Youth Pastor Craig has attack boost (looked in the json and that is my fault, just set it to null)
*FIX > changed from 7 -> null
*NOTE > this rly isnt the best use of my time

@🍋daddydragon🍋 fuck, I forget to write that one down, but hyperdrive has the same issue as Shieldmaiden Wendy
*FIX > look at shieldmaiden wendys fix notes

1. Allow something like "-card {cardName} ff" to pull up the stats for friendly fights and challenge mode (Commons level 4, Rares level 3, Epics level 2, and Legendaries level 1).


2. Allow something like "-card {cardName} art" to pull up just the card art.


3. Allow something like "-card {cardName} M{Level}" to pull up max level stats (M1 = u5, M2 = u15, M3 = u25, M4 = u40, M5 = u55, and M6 = u70)
