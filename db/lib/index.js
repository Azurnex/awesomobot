/*

design:
- functional
- can switch out database without changing interface
- can be exported as new and legacy
- validates input to prevent errors, gives nicer errors than mongo
- no need to use mongo at all outside of this module
- can be expanded when the need arises
- cli for migrations
- data mapping tool
- data validation tool
